\section{Problem definition}
\label{section:problemDefinition}
The purpose of the research in this thesis consists in approaching some alternative methods to replace classic file scanning techniques. Particularly, our target is to demonstrate that Machine Learning algorithms can be used as an efficient mechanism for malicios PDF files detection. Additionally, we want to present a framework that can remotely analyze suspicious PDF files by applying earlier mentioned performant algorithms. This framework has several advantages: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Takes on the complicated task of applying classification model for uploaded files and giving the analysis result to the users.
    \item It is designed to be deployed as a Cloud Application on a powerfull server that can handle multiple requests at the same time, lacking users care about having high specifications for their computers.
    \item Guarantees the privacy of the scanned documents. The algorithms doesn't require the documents content in order to decide whether they are malicios or benign. Also, after analysis process, none of the documents are stored on the Cloud.
    \item Keeps the detection algorithms up-to-date. It won't be the users responsability anymore to regularly update the software antivirus installed on their computers. 
    \item Provides a generic implementation for analyzing uploaded files. The support for a new file extension to be scanned, can be effortlessly added by adding a classifier Machine Learning model for the wanted file format.
\end{itemize}
Integrating both Machine Learning and Cloud Computing into Cybersecurity should provide a significant progress to this field. \par


In order to fully automate the process of detection malicious PDF files, our application provides a tool (currently has support only on Microsoft Windows) that independently uploads files to the Cloud Service, waits for analysis results and takes appropiate protective measures. In the following we will introduce some operating system concepts that helped us to achieve the expected behavior for our application.

\section{Background processes in Microsoft Windows}
\label{section:backgroundProc}

In computing, a background process is a process\footnote{a container for a set of resources used when executing the instance of the program} that runs independently and doesn't require any user involvement. Usually it has the task of system monitoring and sending any types of notifications to the user. Each operating system has its own principle of implementation for background processes. We will have an in-depth look at background processes in Microsoft Windows, which are called \textbf{Windows Services}. According \cite{winInternals} these services are started by a central utility - \textit{Services Control Manager} at the boot-time\footnote{the period when a computer is starting} of the computer and they don't have any graphical interface. For security and safety reasons, specifically to prevent user applications from accessing Windows Services that could run with high privileges, Windows OS creates a new session for each logged in user, reserving \textit{Session 0} for non-interactive services. The mentioned features make Windows Services suitable for long-running functionality, whose operation doesn't interesect with other users work on the same computer. The support for creating a service is provided by \textbf{.NET Framework}, its features being possible to access by using one of Microsoft's high-level programming language \CSharp.

% Since PDF documents became a well known solution for information sharing, they also became a good target for cybercriminals.

\section{Benefits of Cloud Computing}
\label{section:cloudComputing}
% Using a cloud-based anti-virus makes it much easier to manage, especially as there's no need to constantly update software on multiple devices. However, it is worth bearing in mind that installing anti-virus to combat malware can only be one part of an overall IT security policy.
% https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-native-apps/what-are-cloud-applications
% Simply put, a cloud application is software that users access primarily through the internet, meaning at least some of it is managed by a server, not the user’s local machine. This basic definition doesn’t fully describe how cloud applications have reshaped markets and business models, though. If designed well, cloud applications can offer a user experience like a program installed entirely on a local machine, but with reduced resource needs, more convenient updating, and the ability to access functionality across different devices.
% Nowadays with cloud use being common, it's more efficient to install anti-virus software on your network.
