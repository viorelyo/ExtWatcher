\section{Benefits of Cloud Computing}
\label{section:cloudComputing}
% Using a cloud-based anti-virus makes it much easier to manage, especially as there's no need to constantly update software on multiple devices. However, it is worth bearing in mind that installing anti-virus to combat malware can only be one part of an overall IT security policy.

% Simply put, a cloud application is software that users access primarily through the internet, meaning at least some of it is managed by a server, not the user’s local machine. This basic definition doesn’t fully describe how cloud applications have reshaped markets and business models, though. If designed well, cloud applications can offer a user experience like a program installed entirely on a local machine, but with reduced resource needs, more convenient updating, and the ability to access functionality across different devices.
% Nowadays with cloud use being common, it's more efficient to install anti-virus software on your network.
