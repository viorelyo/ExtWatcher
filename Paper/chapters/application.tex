\chapter{Application}
\label{chapter:application}
In this chapter we are going to have an in-depth look at the architecture of our application - \textbf{ExtWatcher}, that represents a solution for the enunciated problem in this thesis.


\section{Design}
\label{section:design}
\textit{ExtWatcher} is a software application assembled from multiple components with different used technologies (see Figure \ref{deployment}). In the following we will introduce you into it's implementation design starting from the low level and we will explain what role each component plays in the context of providing a truly effective security solution.
