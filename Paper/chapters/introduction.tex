\section{Context}
\label{section:context} 
The informational technology progress, that is in continous growth, brings a lot of benefits along with new responsabilities. There are plenty of applications that we use everyday across the entire World Wide Web. We don't even realize how much of our personal information is transfered to the virtual environment. That being said, it's important to be prepared for cybersecurity threats that can misuse our sensitive data. The problem is that the cyber attackers develop a lot of \textit{hacking}\footnote{attempt to gain unauthorized access to data in a system} techniques, which are becoming increasingly difficult to detect. The popular software applications are the best target to inject malicious behavior. This happened with the PDF format. PDF documents are well known, trustworthy files and they are a global solution for sharing information. There are a lot of PDF readers and even browsers and email applications have support to open these files for viewing. It became so convenient to work with this format, that users interact with PDF documents without noticing any possible danger. However PDF is a often used attack vector. The large number of discovered PDF vulnerabilities and also the support of embedding Javascript code into documents are just some of the mostly used exploited methods.
